# vue canvas drawing sample
Originally built this for an open-source online version of Pictionary (at the time of writing, you can find that source code at https://github.com/drweissbrot/ponygon -- that repository might not contain this code anymore at the time you're looking at this). Had to build a canvas editor for work and decided I should publish this separately.
